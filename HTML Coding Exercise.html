<h1>I LOVE BUILDERS OF THE FUTURE ACADEMY!</h1>

<h2>I would love to be accepted to the academy!</h2>

<p>My name is Lisa and I am a technology enthusiast. I wish I had learned to code earlier, but as a child I did not have that opportunity. I am excited to have such opportunities now!</p>

<p>Here are some reasons why I would like to do the Builders of the Future Academy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coding is exciting</li>
<li>I am especially interested in cyber security</li>
<li>IT expertise empowers women</li>
<li>I would like to get a job in IT</li>
</ul>
